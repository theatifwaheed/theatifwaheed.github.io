                                by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section “Refusal of data collection”.</p>



                            <p><strong>Facebook Pixel<br></strong>Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). These allow the behavior of site visitors
                                to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider’s website. This allows an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.

                                to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have
                                no control over how this data is used. Check out Facebook’s privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
